In this command-line application, the user is able to input their seed data including their employees, roles, and department information into the company database. Then, the user will be able to view the departments, roles, and employees along with being able to add them. Lastly, the user is also given the option to update an employee role. This creates a very organized, efficient system for a manager to keep track of their company employees and make changes if necessary in the future.
